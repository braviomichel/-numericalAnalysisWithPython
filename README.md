# Numerical Analysis with Python

This repository contains Python scripts and notebooks focusing on numerical analysis, particularly covering methods such as Cauchy's method, Dirichlet's method, and the finite differences method. These methods are widely used in numerical analysis for solving various mathematical problems, including differential equations, interpolation, and optimization.

## Methods Implemented

### 1. Cauchy's Method

Cauchy's method, also known as the Cauchy integral formula, is a powerful tool in complex analysis used to compute contour integrals of holomorphic functions over closed contours.

### 2. Dirichlet's Method

Dirichlet's method, named after the mathematician Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, is a numerical method used to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) with boundary conditions by transforming the problem into a series of one-dimensional problems.

### 3. Finite Differences Method

The finite differences method is a numerical technique used to approximate the solutions of differential equations by discretizing the domain into a grid and approximating the derivatives using the difference equations.

## Contents
